# maxstellar's Biome Macro
A small macro that detects biomes in the Roblox game Sol's RNG.
This macro started as a small project to detect biomes even when I was using my PC for other things.

## Common Issues
### Macro doesn't detect biomes
- Close ALL instances of Roblox and the macro, and then opening Roblox, and then opening the macro.
- Make sure your PC time is not offset (early or late)

### Macro won't launch (shows error message)
- Make sure the zip file downloaded was extracted fully (into a folder)
- Make sure you are running the macro from the extracted folder (and not from the Home page of File Explorer)
- Delete and reinstall macro

Enjoy!
